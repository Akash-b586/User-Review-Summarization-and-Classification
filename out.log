Text: As an office worker, in fact, there is a car purchase plan. At first, I wanted to buy a used car casually. I can take my wife and children around and play around in my spare time. Usually, public transportation at work is very convenient, and it is close to the unit.After understanding, I found that the second -hand car water was too deep, so I gave up.Buy a new car, at least worry.The beginning of this year, all public transportation was suspended, and once again strengthened the idea of ​​buying a car.During the epidemic period, I was closed to work in the company, and I started to study cars after work.EssenceEssenceThe vehicle introduced some twists and turns, and finally took it -the 21 Mazda CX4 exploration version opened home.After landing 16.5, after 3000 after the subsidy of medical staff, the guidance price was basically landed.It was mentioned in Xuzhou next door. He ran home more than 300 kilometers on the same day -Henan Zhoukou.The process of buying a car is about cars. I did n’t understand before, so I tuned some car knowledge in detail.Determine the direction of car selection, SUV, do not dominate, do not double -clutch, do not have turbocharged, the budget is about 15.Friends heard that I want to buy a car and recommend golf. The advantages are still a lot. Golf is too small and double -clutch, PASS.Mitsubishi's Outlander feels too old, and it is a bit difficult to control his wife. Although there are new models, maybe this name is too long; Jinxuan naturally enters the field of vision.It does not have ESP, security considerations, and PASS.When hesitating, friends recommend steel wires. At first glance, they are very consistent in all aspects. Three major pieces, mechanical quality, control, safety, are good, especially the face value.After watching the car, I experienced the space problem and felt that it was enough. There were not too big people at home.When I was preparing to get 20 models in June, a large number of abnormal sounds suddenly broke out. I finally chose the car that I wish. When I didn't want to change it, I was preparing to take the 20 models.Wait, then 21 models were released in August. It is said that it was changed to solve the abnormal noise. I watched whether there was abnormal noise for a few months. I did not hear the 20 parades of abnormal noise.The car's experience has only one local auto trade with existing cars. I went to see the offer 7K, insurance 4K, and loan fees of 2K.The real car also watched, the price also understood, the important person debuted, my cousin of my country.In the case of the situation, I heard that there were sesame sandalwood cars in Xuzhou, with a discount of 145,000, and the insurance store went out.Decisive, win, install 5.5, one and a half years, 16.5, and then subsidize 3,000, which is 16.2.Full 38 liters of oil on the day, and ran home at a high speed of more than 300 kilometers.The fuel consumption shows 6.5, and now less than two months, the fuel consumption is 7.1, which is very satisfied.In the initial car, I felt the appearance. From the perspective of the front body of the body, it was very heavy, and the lines on the hood were also beautiful.This car is not as thin as the online picture, and it looks very mighty in front. The soul -motion design is a major advantage of the Mazda brand. It combines the sports elements with the static body.Infinite passion, especially the design of the front of the car, there is a certain attack power, a strong layered full -stars inlet grille, silver Mazda logo, sharp Scorpio eye headlights are very beautiful scenery.I think there is still room for improvement in the interior. The vision is not luxurious.There is almost no odor in the car. Only the taste of the new fabric is not the odor. The taste is slightly obvious after the stop time.The function of the vehicle is not used too deeply, it is just tried. It is a bit rude. The voice control cannot reach the next level interface. It is very convenient for Baidu Carlife mobile phone to connect. It is easy to use when you get on the car.There is no fruit mobile phone without using CarPlay.The power performance is quite excellent. If you are not afraid of the oil, you will go down. There are still some pushing back.Called, the overtaking is clean and neat, the power output is very balanced and linear, which is more suitable for urban roads. The reaction of the throttle is very timely. There is obvious feedback on the accelerator. This is very good and very satisfactory.In addition, the oil price of No. 92 is also cheap, and it is not controlled during the running -in period. It only runs the high speed once, and it is basically controlled at about 120 and the high speed is more than 300 kilometers.Around L, there are many in the urban area, and the fuel consumption in the later period should rise.I do n’t know if the fuel consumption will decrease further after the running -in period. Considering that the displacement of 2.0L is also considered a large displacement, it is still satisfied with the fuel consumption performance.Disadvantages: The unsatisfactory places are mainly concentrated in the design and space design. The rear space of the Mazda CX4 does have some depression.There is no problem. For a long time, the legs will definitely feel uncomfortable. The head space of the rear row is not sufficient, mainly caused by the sliding back design of the external contour. This is the truth that fish and palms can not be available.The space measured my brother 1.85, 200 pounds. There is no problem in the front row. The back row is a bit compact. It is obviously not stretched. It is okay for a short time. It is definitely tired for a long time.Big pieces, there is nothing in space.There is also the function of one -click startup with this car but no keyless entry.The radio function is driven by the car by default, and it must be closed manually every time. Who knows how to close it permanently, please tell me.There is also the lacquer is really thin. Walking on the countryside, there are occasional bushes on the roadside to the road. I accidentally rush to the side of the car and get out of the car carefully. There are a few scratches.It is also uncomfortable.You can only drive carefully.In addition, the tire pressure alarm will not show specific tire pressure. Even the tires who call the police must get out of the car for inspection. If you are slow, you can't find it for a while.It accepted everything, and it was not concealed anyway.### Mazda CX-4
Summary: The Mazda CX-4 has received a mixed bag of reviews from various aspects. 

On the positive side, the car's appearance is praised for its beautiful lines and mighty front, making it a visually appealing vehicle. The fuel consumption is also satisfactory, with the owner reporting an average of 6.5 liters per 100 kilometers, which is impressive considering the car's high-speed driving. The power performance is another strong point, with the owner appreciating the timely reaction of the throttle and the obvious feedback on the accelerator.

However, there are some areas where the car falls short. The interior is described as not luxurious, which may be a letdown for some buyers. Moreover, the space in the back row is compact, making it uncomfortable for long trips. 

Overall, the Mazda CX-4 seems to be a solid choice for those prioritizing performance and fuel efficiency, but may not be the best option for those seeking a luxurious interior or ample space.

Text: Follower 2020 car purchases within 1 month of oral evaluation: Since last year, the idea of ​​changing cars.In the end of the Ruijie, there is a short period of time, many plastic parts have begun to aging, and abnormal sounds have begun to appear; second, the business field needs to be appropriately improved to satisfy the vanity.Sometimes 6 people in the family go out together. The three cars in the family are all five, and one belongs to a super -super, and is unwilling to drive MPV; so it takes a comprehensive to change to a 6 or 7 -seat SUV.My preferred goal at the time was Land Rover's new discovery ------ and just the only goal!Because, hey, men have a Land Rover complex!The high sitting position, the slowly rising air suspension, two powerful differential locks, plus 90cm's wading depth, the off -road e -tribe's car logo, leaving, buddy, tank base!So far, set the target in the HSE version of 3.0T. Select the seat ventilation and there is a rear box to sensor the key or something. The test drive twice.I was unaccustomed, but the real high feeling was good, and my wife was persuaded. At that time, I was still the National Five, and I had 610,000 to choose a naked car and gray. As a result, the gray car came to the car to pick up the car,As a result, the price was 640,000 less, and the most hated this kind of non -honest merchant, decisively left!Since the second half of 2019, the price trend discovered by the six of the country has been paying attention to the 4S shop.As a result, I accidentally saw Xia Dong's car program on the Internet ------- I saw his test drive in the United States-this car shape, haha, it's my dish!Immediately joined the flyer to my car change list!When it was about November, the local Lincoln 4S shop said that there was an imported version of the test drive, and he pulled his wife.In order to deepen the impression; I went to the test drive on the same day and found that I found that the pilot was tested; the two cars were compared with the personality characteristics, each with its own style.Land Rover found that the original intention of off -road also took into account the performance of highway; the pilot was exactly the luxurious road of the highway, and you could walk a slightly complicated road, but don't expect it to go off the off -road!In terms of appearance, my wife and I voted for the flyer's ticket, and the buttocks found that the buttocks were too hurtful.In terms of space, the two are not much different; just two rows of comfort, because the height of the second row of seats is too low like a small bench, which is not supported by the thighs; many people buy it.The seat (imported version) was not introduced at all, and the bulging in the middle made me not like it.Looking at the third row of seats, the third row of space discovered is slightly better than the pilot, but sacrificed the trunk space!When driving, I found that it feels more like a boat, but the feeling of highness is that I can't experience it on the pilot!Finally, the configuration is the same, and the pilot configuration is full and found several streets!SO and my wife and I think that the flyer is more suitable for my family!However, at that time, the imported pilots not only had no discounts, but also had a decoration of 20,000 to 40,000 in disguise. It was not a little less. I was resolutely resisting the price increase of the car. No matter any car, this was principles!Coupled with many car reviewers, the online reporters revealed that the pilot is about to be domestically produced, so I decided to wait for 2020 to talk about it!With the relief of the domestic epidemic, the operating status of its own company has gradually recovered, and everything in China is recovering.Domestic flyers also arrived in the second half of the year, waiting for the price to be announced!Then I started my tangled journey ------ first tangled the funny of the pre-sale price, then tangled different versions of configuration, and then tangled the difference between imports and domestic products, and then tangled Changan's quality control.I drove 3 times!The pilot caused greatly, and I had a long -term struggle with the 4S shop. Hehe, the great man once said that fighting with others is endless.At the beginning of the price, not only did there not be discounts, but also to buy 20,000 decoration; later said that the decoration can be less, and finally said that it can not be decorated.When you are about to start, you can see several car owners of the forum that have reported the import version of the imported version and the quality complaints of the domestic version.There is a problem with the car that is not terrible. The terrible thing is that Lincoln manufacturers have a handling attitude and a way of doing things.On the one hand, it is advertising, test car reviews, and water arms to advocate the so -called Lincoln luxury. On the other hand, it is a push for the owner of the problem.So entangled to come to me to drink tea again!Otherwise, look at Q7?IntersectionAfter all, it is BBA, and the brand and quality of mouth are good.Then I went to the Q7 again and talked about the price!I still have old habits. On the same day, I went to the Q7 and pilots respectively.How to say, if the pilot and discovery are compared, the two are distinctive!Then the comparison with the Q7 is not particularly obvious. Both focus on the road.I was originally tangled in the forum, thinking that it is still a pilot, but when I wait for at least half a year to buy it, it is not mainly expected whether the price will be discount, but how much it will focus on the quality of the domestic version.How to perform.However, it is such a strange fate. I have a friend and his classmates who are doing the business of a second -class car dealer. When I heard that I want to buy a car, I directly killed my office and gave it to him in one sentence.Yunyun!Hurrying, I was dumbfounded ------ I haven't agreed yet.Here is 10,000 words. In short, the pilot bought.What everyone wants to know should be the following: the administrative version of the domestic flyer, deep blue, there is no discount, send 5 times of maintenance, electrical steps, films, recorders and Lincoln small gifts.Think about it, my friends still have to give it, and I really like this car, buy it early and enjoy it early!### Flyinger

Text: It is very simple. When you buy GLC, you may remember Macan. When you buy Macan, you will never remember that the budget is Porsche.

What are the options?5 years of loans for 5 years cannot be less. The handling fee plus the license fee of more than 20,000. If it is repaid for a year, it has become more than 630,000.The option is only 670,000 ... ### macan
Summary: The reviewer has shared their experiences with various luxury cars, including GLC, Macan, Macan S, X5, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche. 

They found the GLC to be a neutral option, as it may be comparable to the Macan. The Macan, on the other hand, was a positive choice for the reviewer, as its size was suitable and it was very good. However, they noted that buying a Macan might make one forget that the budget is equivalent to a Porsche.

In contrast, the Macan S was associated with a negative experience when compared to the X5 of 3.0T. The reviewer also did not consider Mercedes-Benz at the same level as the other options. The X5 was specifically criticized for being a complicated option.

The reviewer's budget was limited, and they were torn between the 2.0 Macan and Macan S. They ultimately decided on the ordinary version of the Macan, which they felt was a good choice. 

Overall, the reviewer's preferences leaned towards the Macan and its variants, while they expressed dissatisfaction with the X5 and Mercedes-Benz.

Text: One of the engineers ~~ Ready to change the car at the end of the year. The old car is Harvard H6 manual (currently 185,000 kilometers), and Japanese cars are not considered.Do not consider the tram because there are endurance anxiety.Usually it is more than 100 kilometers a day.At the beginning, Ang Keqi, Q3, X1 also had Hongqi HS5 and other domestic cars.The old car is domestically produced, and the daughter -in -law said she wanted to change the joint venture (not patriotic ...).I didn't pay attention.Ang Keqi has to be booked without the existing car, and the price is a bit tense, Q3 is too small (I am 185), the red flag is a bit officially, and many friends are red flags, so ...When I saw Lincoln on Douyin, I went to understand the Emperor Chalinke.At first I looked at Z, so I took my daughter -in -law to see the car at the 4S shop.It was attracted. After considering that for a while, I felt that Dalian screen was not applicable. Too many failure rates of electronic configuration would be high, and it would be embarrassing to throw half of it if you had a problem.Instead, I went to see the adventurer.Maybe this is the opportunity![Comparison process of choosing a car] Originally, I chose Angke Banner.If there are no preferences in all aspects of the car, the price will be much better.There is no way to give up; Audi Q3 has been opened before, but the space is too small, and many aspects are optional.There is no way to BBA is hard.BMW X1, the daughter -in -law looked good, but went to the 4S shop and tried it. The space was average.It feels like a big size or a two -box sedan.It's really not good.[Car purchase price] There is a shop in Handan, and it can only be talked about.Originally, a friend was there, and I felt that it was worthless.They are all at work, and the rights in their hands are limited, why find this trouble.Two talks may be near the Spring Festival. It ’s hard to talk, and the price is very tight.The price of two -wheel drive Zunya will not come down when it comes to 24.5 (we can't do it), and then the gift, the foot pad, the membrane (not, the film is not good for the driving recorder), the air frying pot, six timesMaintenance (don't send it for nothing, we still know the way of knowing it is basic maintenance, they are all learned by Emi Lili) and other miscellaneous gifts.When the insurance talks, it is said that it is not forced to buy it in the store. When you go to the insurance, you must buy it in the store. You must buy it in the store. When you talk about it, you say that you must buy it in the store in the first year, and I am very disgusted.Because they all told their classmates (he is the manager of the PICC, there are many discounts).There is no way to get this step, then buy 7000.Finally, the purchase tax, half of the manufacturer subsidies.Retreat in the second month.The installment is short loan.[Vehicle workmanship] The vehicle workmanship is very good because it is a US car.It is impossible to be compact, and it will be more perfect under the details of domesticization.After an example, the windshift pipe of the windshield is exposed. Once there is a damaged back box, it is a connection man!And it is not beautiful, my little 6 is invisible.Later, when the wind glass water pipe is the same, [odor] The new car did not find a odor, or the sequelae after the sun may not smell it!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionHowever, the floor pad is a bit leather, but we have freshness and aromatherapy. If we ca n’t choose a treasure to buy bamboo charcoal, it can solve the drip.[Space] The space is not like a compact car. After I sit in, I do n’t feel crowded (unlike 3 cats), the back row is okay, and the back supports adjustment.However, there are two points. One is that the rear seats are a bit short, and it will be uncomfortable for a long time. The other is that the seat belt buckle is a bit stingy. It is recommended to sink a two centimeters ....... perfect.The trunk space is a bit, it ’s really better to install ...In the first row, the second row is the second row, then you can only sacrifice the trunk.The rear space of the trunk space [sound insulation treatment] From the comments of the car emperor, 80%of the adventurers chose the adventurer because of the quiet and neat sex of the car.I did a good job in sound insulation. The tire noise filtering was very good. I felt like 80 miles on the wind noise. I guess it was almost like this, after all, it was an SUV.Wind resistance is objective.Also, the engine sound is a bit obvious (personal feeling), but I like to listen to songs on the car, you can ignore it!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection[Advantages] The configuration detailed configuration will not go into details. Knowing the car emperor (you can also see the car home and the car can be seen).In terms of power, the entire department is equipped with 2.0T245 horsepower.No different treatment, making people very comfortable.The point is that he still eats 92, surprise, no accident!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionThe front row seat heating seats are very practical. The old cars used to have seat heating, and I knew it.The unexpected surprise was that the steering wheel heating was also equipped with happiness.There is also a seat memory, comfortable in and out, and the sense of sense of welcoming is full (although I am a person who doesn't care about forms, there can be a little vanity).In terms of security, ACC, lanes maintained, anti -collision warnings, and reversing side warnings are indeed safe.Test it in person, better than simple fixed speed!Although more than ten years old, there are these more assured.The appearance is platinum diamond white, low -key without losing luxury.The model can only be benevolent, and wise men are wise!The front face [disadvantage] less than a month of test car, forced to say some disadvantages 1. High brakes, hard brakes, and short brake strokes are not convenient to control.Personally, it is okay, maybe driving for a long time?Generally, it is okay to adapt.2. Fuel consumption, there seems to be no fuel saving in 2.0T, no more than 13 oils are not expense (do not spray, only represent personal opinions).No need to see the fuel consumption of the computer, how many kilometers to run with a box of oil came out. I calculated it myself. The 1300 kilometers are currently 9.4.3. Sync+system, it's not easy to use, I can't use it here.4. Car navigation, such a luxurious car, I feel that using Gaode is perfect. It is not that Baidu map is not good. Its satellite map is still very useful.But daily navigation is not as good as Gaode.5. Automatically start and stop, this function is very controversial.Some people are willing to use it, and some people are disgusted, but forced opening is a tuning point.[Last summary] It's so much. In short, the adventurer's car corresponds to this price.As for what advantages and disadvantages, in a word, the car is driven by people.Do not let the car control people.Finally, thank you family, I wish you peace in 2023 and get rich!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionPlease recommend to refine!Intersection###adventurer
Summary: The Adventurer offers a well-rounded experience with both positive and negative aspects. 

On the positive side, the vehicle's workmanship is reliable and of high quality, making it a great choice for those who value durability. The space inside the car is also impressive, providing ample room for passengers and not feeling cramped like a compact car. The sound insulation treatment is excellent, effectively filtering out tire noise and wind noise, creating a comfortable driving experience. The power department is also equipped with a 2.0T245 horsepower engine, making it smooth and comfortable to drive. Additionally, the car features practical seat heating and steering wheel heating, as well as advanced security features such as ACC, lane maintenance, anti-collision warnings, and reversing side warnings.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The rear seats are a bit short, which may cause discomfort during long drives. The seat belt buckle is also a bit stingy, which may be a minor inconvenience. Furthermore, the new car may not have a strong odor, but the floor pad has a leather smell that may require regular freshness and aromatherapy.

Overall, the Adventurer is a solid choice for those who value reliability, space, and advanced features, but may need to consider the drawbacks of the rear seats and seat belt buckle.
